# Loan Risk Prediction Challenge – #DATAMONDAYVIEWS

Welcome to the **Everything Data #DATAMONDAYVIEWS Challenge**! This week's challenge involves exploring a loan dataset to derive insights, analyze risk factors, and build predictive models for loan defaults.

---

## 📂 Dataset Access
The dataset for this challenge, **Loan Risk Prediction Dataset**, is available on Kaggle. Please download it from the following link:
- **[Loan Risk Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ganjerlawrence/loan-risk-prediction-dataset)**

*Note:* If you don’t have a Kaggle account, you’ll need to create one to access the dataset.

---

## 📊 Challenge Objectives

### Beginners
   - Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset.
   - Identify insights on loan distribution, applicant demographics, default rates, and factors influencing loan approval.

### Advanced
   - Perform EDA and **Feature Engineering** to improve the dataset for predictive modeling.
   - Build a **classification model** to predict loan default risks using the dataset.
